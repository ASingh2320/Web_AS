	<h2>Work Experience</h2>
	<h3>Summer Youth Employment Program Intern, Long Island City </h3>
	<h4>July 2019 - August 2019</h4>
	<div class="description">
		I worked as an intern doing clerical work at the affiliate worksite at LaGuardia Community College. Although I worked without a computer, I still had to do data managment. Like a human disk defragger, I organized timesheets from 2016 to 2019 to be sent for storage which lead to more shelf space in the office.<br>
	</div>
	
	<h2>Skills</h2>
	<h3>Java</h3>
	<div class="description">
		Java is one of my most proficient languages. Much of my computer science coursework (CSE 114: Intro. to Object Orientated Programming, CSE 214: Data Structures and Algorithms), and outside work/projects have been in Java. I know how to implement basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, etc. and use techniques such as recursion in Java. <br>
	</div>
	<h3>Python</h3>
	<div class="description">
		Python is the second of my most proficient languages. I have used Python for projects in my IAE 101: Digital Intelligence class and my personal projects like my "Beginner's Chess Module" and my attempted solutions to a few problem sets from Cory Altoff's <em> The Self-Taught Programmer</em>. I know how to implement structures such as lists and code recursively. <br>
	</div>
	<h3>Website Design - HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery)</h3>
	<div class="description">
		I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build this website that you are viewing now. For the JavaScript portion in particular, I learned basic jQuery functions such as hover and click functions to design various buttons, links, and other functionality present in this site.<br>
	</div>
	<h3>LaTex</h3>
	<div class="description">
		I used Latex in CSE 215: Foundations of Computer Science course. I used Latex to write out the solutions to discrete mathematics problems that I worked on in the course. <br>
	</div>
