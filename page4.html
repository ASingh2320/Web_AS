		Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. I have created this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery). 
		This website is meant to be a professional development page that displays my projects and resume for those interested. I also 
		intend for this to be a sort of a journal that records my progress as I (hopefully) get better at various computer science skills.
		Feel free to email any project ideas that you would like me to do for you at the email listed below.<br>
