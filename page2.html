		I’ve recently discovered that chess games can be saved in an online format called PGN files. Kind of like commonly known PDF files. These files are formatted in such a way that they can be parsed for data such as who is playing and what moves were made in a game. I aim to make parser that goes through the file and sets up a visualizer on a chess board.

		This project is an encryption/decryption program based in Java. The program uses 8 relatively simple encryption techniques to encrypt and decrypt messages. This program used heavy String manipulation for rearranging the texts to be encrypted/decrypted. In terms of data structures, I used arrays to manipulate characters for the cryptography. For example, I used a 2D array to develop the “fence” of the rail-fence cypher. Encryption techniques include: Atbash, ROT13, Caesar, Rail-fence, Polybius Square, Simple Substitution, Columnar Transposition, and Vigenere.  
		<br>
		Future Updates: Add try-catch for invalid inputs, add more encryption techniques.

		This project is a beginner friendly chessboard based in Python. The program shows beginner players the basic movements of chess pieces. Each piece is moveable similar to a real-life chessboard. There is also feature which shows possible moves of a piece when selected. The chessboard was constructed out of a 2D array of objects, and the movement mechanics were based on piece objects moving on the 2D array.
		<br> 
		Future Updates: Add intermediate techniques such as castling and en passant, add check and mate mechanics.
